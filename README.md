# web-coding-challenge
This project is the result of a 4 hour coding exercise:
- Write a web app that uses the GIPHY image search API and shows the results in a 1-column scrollable view (like Instagram).
- The app must let users enter queries, such as "kittens".
- The app must support endless scrolling, automatically requesting and displaying more images when the user scrolls to the bottom of the view.
- We should be able to clone your code from Github, then run the project by following a README.

Coded and sent on the Sunday 3rd of March, 2019.
